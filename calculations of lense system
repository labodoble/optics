#Two lense system: 

1/f=1/f1+1/f2-d/f1*f2
f- focus length of two lenses system
f1 - focus of 1. lense
f2 - focus of 2. lense
d - distance between two lenses

when f1=f2
f=f1^2/(2*f1-d)


#Macro lense system for optical printer:

a = f(1+1/m)
b = f(1+m)

a - distance between lense and level of reproduced film
b - distance between lense and level of the film which will be exposed
f - focus length of lense
m - ratio of magnitud between original image and the exposed one
